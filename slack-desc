gsm: GSM (A GSM speech compressor)
gsm:
gsm: This package contains runtime shared library and user binaries of GSM,
gsm: an implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
gsm: full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
gsm: (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
gsm: GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling rate,
gsm: i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits;  for compatibility with
gsm: typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
gsm: 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).  The quality
gsm: of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker recognition;  even
gsm: music often survives transcoding in recognizable form (given the
gsm: bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
gsm: The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
gsm: a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
gsm: on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against
gsm: the ETSI standard test patterns.
